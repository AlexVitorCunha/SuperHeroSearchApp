# Super Hero Search App

Here's my demo - https://www.loom.com/share/de4aaeada9454172a0225ad92362d611

## Purpose

> This application was developed in my COMP1011 Advanced Object Oriented Programming-Java course at Georgian College.
> I was asked to create an application that takes user input, makes a call to an API to return search results
> and allows users to see more information of a specific entry. My chosen API was the free version of the
> SuperHero Search API (https://rapidapi.com/jakash1997/api/superhero-search/details), which returns superhero
> information.

## Technologies Learned

- JavaFX
- CSS
- APIs

## Launch
